# AI Governance Toolkit

> 🚧 **Work in Progress** - Actively developing comprehensive AI governance and compliance tools

An open-source Python toolkit for ethical AI development, focusing on transparency, fairness, and regulatory compliance. Built to help developers and organizations ensure their AI systems meet modern governance standards.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The AI Governance Toolkit addresses the growing need for responsible AI development by providing automated tools for:

- **Model Documentation**: Standardized model cards for transparency
- **Bias Detection**: Comprehensive fairness auditing across demographics  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: EU AI Act, GDPR, and other regulatory frameworks
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated AI risk classification and mitigation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time governance tracking for production models

## ✨ Key Features

### 📋 Model Card Generation 
- Automated model documentation following industry standards
- Customizable templates for different use cases
- Integration with popular ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face)

### 🔍 Bias Auditing Suite
- Multi-dimensional bias detection (demographic, intersectional, representation)
- Statistical fairness metrics (disparate impact, equalized odds, demographic parity)
- Visual bias reports with actionable recommendations

### ⚖️ Compliance Checking
- **EU AI Act**: Risk categorization, transparency requirements, documentation
- **GDPR**: Data protection and algorithmic decision-making compliance
- **NIST AI Framework**: Risk management alignment

### 🎛️ Risk Assessment
- Automated AI system risk classification
- Impact analysis across stakeholder groups
- Mitigation strategy recommendations

### 📊 Explainability Dashboard
- SHAP, LIME, and attention-based explanations
- Interactive visualizations for model decisions
- Stakeholder-friendly explanation formats
